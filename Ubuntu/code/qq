       UPDATE  controls which existing files in the destination are re‚Äê
       placed.  'all' is the default operation when an [1m--update  [22moption
       is  not specified, and results in all existing files in the des‚Äê
       tination being replaced.  'none' is similar to the  [1m--no-clobber[0m
       option,  in  that  no files in the destination are replaced, but
       also skipped files do not induce a failure.  'older' is the  de‚Äê
       fault operation when [1m--update [22mis specified, and results in files
       being  replaced  if  they're older than the corresponding source
       file.

       The backup suffix is '~',  unless  set  with  [1m--suffix  [22mor  SIM‚Äê
       PLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.   The  version control method may be selected
       via the [1m--backup [22moption or through the VERSION_CONTROL  environ‚Äê
       ment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if [1m--backup [22mis given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups
